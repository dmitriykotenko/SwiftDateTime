# SwiftDateTime

Library to work with dates and times.

Inspired by numerous torments when dealling with calendar dates in iOS applications.

## Basic structs

DayMonthYear – date in its usual meaning (i. e. calendar date, like "September 7, 2008")

HoursMinutesSeconds — time of day accurate to milliseconds (e. g. "02:00:24.046")

LocalDateTime — date and time, without time zone (e. g. "September 7, 2008, 02:00:24.046")

DateTime — date and time, including time zone offset (e. g. "September 7, 2008, 02:00:24.046, +3 hours from UTC")
